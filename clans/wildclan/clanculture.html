          <h1>Wildclan - Clan Culture</h1>
          
          <h2>Religious Practices</h2>
          
          <h3>Divers</h3>
          
          <p>Below the camp, just above the crashing waves, sits a tunnel burrowing deep into the rock. At the end of this tunnel, a wide cave full of seawater glows with luminescent algae and worms. These glowing figures reflect upon the water like stars. This cave connects Wildclan to Starclan, and provides a close connection to their ancestors, cats will come here to have a moment of peace. However, this cave is only accessible during low tide, and quickly fills up when the sea reaches higher. Due to their close connection to Starclan, Wildclan is very devoted to their starry ancestors. All cats of the clan feel a closeness to them, if they choose to follow the guidance offered to them. </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>Belief in the clan's ancestors is not expected nor required of the clan's inhabitants, and those who do not are not seen as strange or different.</li>
            <li>Vigils are held in this cave rather than in the center of camp.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Contrary to the other clans, Wildclan does not worship any deities, guardians, or patrons. Instead, they turn their attention to Starclan as a whole, appreciating the presence and general guidance from their Starclan ancestors.</p>
          
          <br>
          <h2>Clan Traditions</h2>
          
          <ul>
            <li>Upon apprenticeship of a kit or arrival of a cat, they are bestowed a necklace made of shells and shiny rocks. The heart of this necklace is the shell, handpicked by the cat themself to wear throughout their life in Wildclan. This is not only a sacred accessory, but also signifies their alignment to Wildclan.</li>
            <li>A common victory celebratory practice for Wildclan members is firefly gathering. On a windy day, cats gather all the fireflies that they can find and wrap them with leaves, then setting them free and watching them ascend towards the sky, mimicking that of floating lanterns.</li>
            <li>Year round, Wildclan cats celebrate by building sandcastles. They may not look like much, but the experience of working together to create the best possible ‘castle’ is irreplaceable. Two to four cats partner together to build these.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <br>
          <h2>Ceremonies</h2>
          
          <h3>Apprentice</h3>
          
          <p>At the age of 6 moons, a kit will be summoned forward during a clan meeting. Immediately following, leader will descent the stone and touch noses, and the new apprentice gets to go outside camp for the first time and pick the shell they want for their bracelet, bringing it back for the Weaving Club to craft.</p>
          
          <h3>Medicine Cat</h3>
          
          <p>When medicine cat apprentices complete training and are ready to have their full medicine cat name given, their mentor will take them to a shallow part of the ocean and perform a ritual almost like a baptism. When underwater, if they see an array of dancing stars and lights, it is a certain sign that Starclan has accepted the completion of their apprenticeship and welcomes the new feline as a full fledged medicine cat.</p>
          
          <h3>Sentinel</h3>
          
          <p>The decision has been made to become a Sentinel. The retiring cat will take a group of 3-4 friends with them and do one last walk around the territory under the title of their current rank. When back in camp, the cats gather in the starry cave for the ceremony, and the honorific “Sentinel” will be gained.</p>
