This is uploaded to github to both have a backup of the site, even if it is currently the old version, and to allow members of staff to help with allegiences.
IF YOU WANT TO HELP, YOU ONLY NEED TO USE THE ALLEGIENCES FILE! 
Go in there, edit it to your heart's content to include more or less cats and share to me the results and I'll update the website to include your additions. Ty! Ly!
